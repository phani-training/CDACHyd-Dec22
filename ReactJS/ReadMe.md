# What is ReactJs?
- React is a JS library developed by Facebook for creating User responsive Web Apps and display the contents to the user in a faster manner. 
- React is primarily used for creating Single Page Applications(SPAs).    
- It uses a concept called Virtual DOM where the React Library creates an in-memory DOM structure of the elements that U want to display on UR Real browser while building the Application which will be displayed on the Real DOM when viewed in the actual browser. 
- As the elements are created at the virtual level itself, while displaying it will be faster as it simply recreates the DOM structure on the Physical Browser.
-It contains reusable UI Components that become the part of the Application. UR React App will be made of many such modular, small reusable components that will be made as a Complete Application.
- In React App Development, U will create many such reusable UI Components that will finally be combined to form one full app. 
- The main objective of React App is to create Web Apps in more optimized manner. It allows programmers to create UI Components that have logic as well as HTML Content with events, properties and State as one UNIT when the UI Component is rendered to the Browser.
- React is purely a Client side Technology for building robust Web Apps. The content will be dynamic and fast. 
- React Apps are built using Components, which is based on COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE. 
    - UR App is a combination of various ready to use re-usable COmponents that has HTML, CSS and many web content combined as one SINGLE Unit. These units are resuable. 
    - UR Files will contain both JS and XML in it.These files are saved as JSX Files(JS + XML). The Virtual DOM will be created using XML and JS acts like the Code behind to bind those DOM elements with the content that U want to publish. 
    - Technically, all Components are classes of JS that inherits from a class called React.Component Class. 

# Software requirements of React Development:
1. Any OS like Windows, MacOS or  any other Linux Flavors
2. Nodejs for hosting support and NPM support. 
3. React App Template using CLI(Command Line Interface)

# Steps to create a React App:
1. Install the npm package called npx, the CLI for building React Apps.
    - npm install -g npx
2. Use the following command to create a Simple react App
    - npx create-react-app nameoftheApp
3. Move to the newly created directory in the name of the Application. 
    - cd nameOftheApp
5. Run the following command to start the Application:  
    - npm start ->React App will run...
